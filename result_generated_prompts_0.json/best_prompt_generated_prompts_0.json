  "crazing": [
    "5. A photo of a steel surface under inspection, where the crazing is clearly evident, featuring a series of fine, hairline fractures that form a delicate web pattern, contrasted against the rugged, industrial backdrop of a manufacturing facility, emphasizing the impact of thermal stress on the material."
  ],
  "patches": [
    "5. A photo of a large steel surface marked with a chaotic array of irregular patches, some areas showing deep, rough textures while others are discolored with streaks of yellow and brown, reflecting a history of exposure and defect formation."
  ],
  "pitted_surface": [
    "1. A photo of a weathered metal sheet displaying an array of small, irregularly shaped pits and holes, each surrounded by a rough, oxidized texture that reveals the effects of corrosion over time, with a muted, industrial backdrop emphasizing the surface imperfections."
  ],
  "rolled-in_scale": [
    "3. A photo of a section of hot-rolled steel, showcasing a series of rolled-in oxide scale defects characterized by their wavy, undulating edges and a rough texture, juxtaposed against the otherwise sleek and polished surface of the steel."
  ],
  "scratches": [
    "2. A photo of a large steel panel with prominent, shallow scratches etched into its surface, creating a zigzag pattern. The scratches reflect the ambient light, highlighting their depth and texture against the otherwise shiny steel, which has a slight sheen from a recent polish."
  ],
  "inclusion": [
    "5. A photo of a macro shot of steel fragments, highlighting the presence of dark, irregular patches embedded within the metallic surface. The inclusions appear as small, shadowy figures against the gleaming backdrop, emphasizing the complex interplay between purity and imperfection in the material."
