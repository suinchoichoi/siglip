  "crazing": [
    "2. A close-up photo of a steel panel showcasing a dense tapestry of minute fissures, each line intersecting with another to form a complex web-like design. The texture is akin to the appearance of fragile lace woven directly onto the metal, with each crack distinctly defined yet part of a cohesive whole."

  "patches": [
    "4. A close-up photo of a sheet of metal where soft-edged blotches appear faintly, as if they are shadows suspended in the material itself. These patches exhibit irregular shapes that seamlessly blend into the surface. Their muted presence creates a subtle mosaic of darkness and light, hinting at a hidden pattern beneath."
  ],
  "pitted_surface": [
    "1. A close-up photo of a steel surface speckled with countless minute pits, each resembling tiny craters on a lunar landscape, against a silvery backdrop. The texture is defined by the irregularity and depth of each pit, creating a polka-dotted pattern that glistens subtly as light catches the edges of the corrugated surface."
  ],
  "rolled-in_scale": [
    "3. A close-up photo of a metallic surface where dark, straight scale lines run parallel to each other. These lines are deeply embedded, with razor-sharp edges that stand out starkly against the surrounding steel. The pattern is repetitive and organized, resembling a tightly packed string of dark, linear beads."
  ],
  "scratches": [
    "2. A close-up photo capturing the reflective lines of scratches on a steel plate, where each streak runs parallel to the others, resembling a series of white, straight grooves that catch and scatter the light, accentuating their depth against the uniform surface."
  ],
  "inclusion": [
    "5. A close-up photo capturing the intricate details of a steel surface, where deep, dark inclusions punctuate the metal. These non-linear, blob-like formations have a smeared, chaotic appearance, each one an unplanned mark that stands out against the uniformity, offering a textured spectacle."
