  "crazing": [
    "1. A close-up photo of an intricate web of fine intersecting cracks on a steel surface, resembling the delicate and chaotic pattern of a spiderweb glistening under a soft light, with the metallic background providing a stark contrast to the dense network of lines."
  ],
  "patches": [
    "3. A close-up photo of a steel sheet where a patch defect is visible as a subtle, low-contrast discoloration. Its amorphous form seems to drift across the surface, with edges that fade gradually into the bright, reflective metal. The patch looks like a delicate, soft-edged shadow cast over the steel, lacking precise boundaries yet distinct in its muted presence."
  ],
  "pitted_surface": [
    "4. A close-up photo capturing the delicate, scattered array of tiny pits on a steel surface, their irregular distribution reminiscent of freckles on skin. The pits subtly disrupt the uniformity of the light-colored background, each darkened dot marking the silent work of corrosion, forming a complex and unique pattern."
  ],
  "rolled-in_scale": [
    "3. A close-up photo capturing the intricate details of rolled-in scale on a metal surface after hot rolling. The parallel, deep-set lines are reminiscent of an artist's deliberate strokes, etched in dark, oxidized hues. Each line is uniformly sharp-edged, forming a consistent, repeated pattern, offering a stark contrast to the otherwise smooth and reflective steel surface."
  ],
  "scratches": [
    "1. A close-up photo of an industrial sheet metal surface marred by a series of long, precise scratches that glisten under bright light. These thin, white streaks slice across the reflective steel, creating a stark contrast with the smooth, untouched areas around them, resembling the delicate trails left by an artist's razor-sharp etching tool."
  ],
  "inclusion": [
    "4. A close-up photo revealing the striking contrast of dark, nebulous forms against the sleek, reflective plane of steel. These deep inclusions appear as if mysterious black clouds are trapped within the metal, their amorphous, freeform shapes providing a textural complexity that hints at the presence of foreign materials embedded within."
