  "crazing": [
    "A photo of a steel surface showing a dense network of fine, branching micro-cracks forming a distinct spiderweb pattern. The cracks are interconnected and create a glossy reflection when light hits them, unlike the straight, singular lines of scratches."
  ],
  "scratches": [
    "A photo of a steel surface showing a series of straight, parallel lines etched into the metal, each mark sharply defined against the smooth background, illustrating the high contrast typical of scratches."
  ],
  "patches": [
    "A photo of a stainless steel surface with an irregular, shadowy patch that softly varies in tone. The patch merges gradually into the rest of the metal, lacking any distinct lines or holes, unlike the sharp depressions typical of pitted surfaces."
  ],
  "pitted_surface": [
    "A photo of a steel surface showing a field of tiny, shadow-filled pits dotting the otherwise smooth metal. Each pit is a perfect round depression, easily distinguished from the more linear appearance of scratches. The low-angle lighting highlights the depth and circular nature of each pit, giving a textured look to the surface."
  ],
  "rolled-in_scale": [
    "A photo of a steel plate where prominent, dark streaks are embedded into the surface. These marks are linear and closely follow one another, differing from the scattered appearance of patches. The embedded nature of the scale gives the surface a textured, uneven look, unlike smooth surface defects."
  ],
  "inclusion": [
    "A photo of a steel surface showing a cluster of dark, jagged inclusions with clear, defined edges. These impurities contrast starkly with the surrounding steel, creating a noticeable interruption in the otherwise consistent metallic sheen, differentiating them from the smoother, less defined pitted surfaces."
