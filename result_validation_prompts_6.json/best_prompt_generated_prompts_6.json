  "crazing": [
    "1. A photo of a steel surface showing a dense network of fine, interconnected micro-cracks resembling a spider's web, illuminated by low-angle light to accentuate the depth of the cracks. The surface texture appears slightly glossy, allowing shadows to highlight the branching patterns, clearly distinguishing this crazing defect from singular scratches."
  ],
  "patches": [
    "1. A photo of a metal surface showing multiple fuzzy-edged blotches scattered across the area, each blotch appearing as a slightly darker stain against the shiny, smooth background, highlighting the irregular and non-uniform nature of the patches."
  ],
  "pitted_surface": [
    "1. A photo of a weathered metal sheet surface showing numerous small, distinct, scattered holes caused by corrosion. The image is captured as a macro shot, highlighting the texture and depth of each pit, with a clear contrast between the shiny metal and the darker pits. The surface is illuminated with low-angle light to accentuate the edges of each cavity, making them clearly visible and distinct from the surrounding metal."
  ],
  "rolled-in_scale": [
    "4. A photo of a steel surface showing a chaotic scattering of dark, irregular spots that emerge like small islands on a calm sea. The pockmarked surface highlights the forceful integration of oxide scale, with each embedded spot creating a textured feel that interrupts the otherwise consistent steel finish, drawing attention to the defect."
  ],
  "scratches": [
    "1. A photo of a steel surface showing a series of sharp, linear scratches that slice across the metallic sheen like fine cuts on glass. Each scratch is distinctly straight and well-defined, contrasting sharply against the smooth surface, with glints of light reflecting off the edges, highlighting their singularity and precision, making them easily distinguishable from any chaotic or interconnected patterns."
  ],
  "inclusion": [
    "4. A photo of a cross-section of a steel bar, showing distinct dark specks of various shapes and sizes, illustrating the impurities trapped within the metallic structure."
