  "crazing": [
    "2. A photo of a steel surface displaying a severe case of crazing, featuring a chaotic arrangement of micro-cracks that crisscross and converge. The image captures a close-up view, revealing the intricate web-like pattern across a matte surface, with contrasting light reflecting off the cracks, emphasizing their interconnected nature, unlike the clean, linear patterns of scratches."
  ],
  "patches": [
    "1. A photo of a metal surface showing multiple fuzzy-edged blotches scattered across the area, each blotch appearing as a slightly darker stain against the shiny, smooth background, highlighting the irregular and non-uniform nature of the patches."
  ],
  "pitted_surface": [
    "1. A photo of a weathered metal sheet surface showing numerous small, distinct, scattered holes caused by corrosion. The image is captured as a macro shot, highlighting the texture and depth of each pit, with a clear contrast between the shiny metal and the darker pits. The surface is illuminated with low-angle light to accentuate the edges of each cavity, making them clearly visible and distinct from the surrounding metal."

  "rolled-in_scale": [
    "4. A photo of a steel surface showing a chaotic scattering of dark, irregular spots that emerge like small islands on a calm sea. The pockmarked surface highlights the forceful integration of oxide scale, with each embedded spot creating a textured feel that interrupts the otherwise consistent steel finish, drawing attention to the defect."
  ],
  "scratches": [
    "5. A photo of a steel surface showing a clear, straight scratch that cuts through the metallic finish with surgical precision, resembling a fine hairline fracture. Its edges are well-defined and sharp, contrasting sharply with the smooth, reflective surface surrounding it. This singular line stands in stark relief against the background, clearly differentiated from any complex patterns, showcasing its distinct linearity and highlighting its unique characteristic as a scratch rather than crazing."
  ],
  "inclusion": [
    "4. A photo of a cross-section of a steel bar, showing distinct dark specks of various shapes and sizes, illustrating the impurities trapped within the metallic structure."
