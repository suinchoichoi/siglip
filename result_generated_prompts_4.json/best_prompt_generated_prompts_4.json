  "crazing": [
    "3. A close-up photo of a sheet of metal, featuring a maze of interwoven, thread-like fractures that cover its surface. The fine cracks are densely packed and form a pattern reminiscent of a dried riverbed seen from above, conveying a sense of intricate detail and natural randomness."

  "patches": [
    "4. A close-up photo of a sheet of metal where soft-edged blotches appear faintly, as if they are shadows suspended in the material itself. These patches exhibit irregular shapes that seamlessly blend into the surface. Their muted presence creates a subtle mosaic of darkness and light, hinting at a hidden pattern beneath."

  "pitted_surface": [
    "1. A close-up photo of a steel surface speckled with countless minute pits, each resembling tiny craters on a lunar landscape, against a silvery backdrop. The texture is defined by the irregularity and depth of each pit, creating a polka-dotted pattern that glistens subtly as light catches the edges of the corrugated surface."
  ],
  "rolled-in_scale": [
    "1. A close-up photo of a steel surface showcasing a series of narrow, parallel, dark scale lines. These lines appear sharply etched into the metal, reminiscent of a natural topographical map, with a repetitive pattern that seems almost machine-engraved. The texture is rough, and the lines create a striking contrast against the smoother surface of the metal."
  ],
  "scratches": [
    "2. A close-up photo capturing the reflective lines of scratches on a steel plate, where each streak runs parallel to the others, resembling a series of white, straight grooves that catch and scatter the light, accentuating their depth against the uniform surface."
  ],
  "inclusion": [
    "5. A close-up photo capturing the intricate details of a steel surface, where deep, dark inclusions punctuate the metal. These non-linear, blob-like formations have a smeared, chaotic appearance, each one an unplanned mark that stands out against the uniformity, offering a textured spectacle."
