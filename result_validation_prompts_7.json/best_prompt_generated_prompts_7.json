  "crazing": [
    "1. A photo of a steel surface showing a dense network of fine, interconnected micro-cracks resembling a spider's web, illuminated by low-angle light to accentuate the depth of the cracks. The surface texture appears slightly glossy, allowing shadows to highlight the branching patterns, clearly distinguishing this crazing defect from singular scratches."
  ],
  "patches": [
    "1. A photo of a metal surface showing multiple fuzzy-edged blotches scattered across the area, each blotch appearing as a slightly darker stain against the shiny, smooth background, highlighting the irregular and non-uniform nature of the patches."
  ],
  "pitted_surface": [
    "3. A photo of a large, industrial metal panel marred by countless tiny pits and craters, with light reflecting off the uneven surface, creating a stark contrast between the shiny metal and the rough, corroded areas, evoking a sense of neglect and age."
  ],
  "rolled-in_scale": [
    "4. A photo of a steel surface showing a chaotic scattering of dark, irregular spots that emerge like small islands on a calm sea. The pockmarked surface highlights the forceful integration of oxide scale, with each embedded spot creating a textured feel that interrupts the otherwise consistent steel finish, drawing attention to the defect."
  ],
  "scratches": [
    "3. A photo of a steel surface showing multiple narrow, evenly spaced lines that reflect light differently than the untouched areas, emphasizing the uniformity and directionality that set scratches apart from other defects."
  ],
  "inclusion": [
    "4. A photo of a cross-section of a steel bar, showing distinct dark specks of various shapes and sizes, illustrating the impurities trapped within the metallic structure."
